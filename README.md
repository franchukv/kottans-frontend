## Git Basics

   Thanks to the **"Introduction to Git and GitHub"** course, I refreshed my knowledge of Git and learned several useful and previously unknown commands.<br><br>
  
  <img alt="Introduction to Git and GitHub" src="/git-and-github/img/Introduction to Git and GitHub.jpg"><br><br>
  
   The site [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) surprised me with the fact that there is something similar for studying Git, it was interesting to go through the tasks, I consider it very useful for learning the material that there is an opportunity to visually work with quite abstract concepts, such as brunches, etc.<br><br>

  > P.S. Previously, I already created a **[Git cheat sheet](https://github.com/franchukv/Git-Commands/)** for myself, in which I described all the commands I know in my own words.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

[Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/) was an interesting journey, I know that Linus Torvalds created Linux and Git, so it was interesting to see the same decisions in the command names and in general to observe the behavior and logic of the system.

  <img width="49%" height="285px" alt="quiz-4" src="/task_linux_cli/img/quiz-4.jpg"><br><br>


Articles about **HTTP** was interesting and useful. I found them some hard to understand some details at first because of a lot of theory, but at end of article I found that all this puzzle was made up correct in my head!<br><br>
So definitely all this information will be useful in the future to understand some things.

## Git Collaboration

  <p>

  Speaking of **"The Introduction to Git and GitHub"** course, it was good, but a little superficial for me.
  I learned a few new commands and understood the Git workflow in teamwork, and it was really helpful, so a big thanks to the guys at Google and Kottans for this info :)<br><br>

  <img width="49%" height="450px" alt="week1" src="/task_git_collaboration/img/week1.jpg">
  <img width="49%" height="450px" alt="week2" src="/task_git_collaboration/img/week2.jpg">
  <img width="49%" height="450px" alt="week3" src="/task_git_collaboration/img/week3.jpg">
  <img width="49%" height="450px" alt="week4" src="/task_git_collaboration/img/week4.jpg"><br><br>

  [Learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) was very nice, I had a lot of fun when I do exercises and I got pleasure when did it right. <br>
  > U know, I was surprised from fact that exist two camps, first "Merge" and second "Rebase", in fact I'm more with "second" guys because I more like clean tree.<br>
  
  <br>

  To summarize, it was really informative, but maybe too much for current me, I hope that all of this information will be more practical for future me.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

  <p>

  Speaking about **"Intro to HTML & CSS"** course, I already knew before a lot from first two parts course's material, but it was useful to repeat some things.<br>

  > Was very and very useful to learn information about "box-model", in particular `box-sizing: border-box`.

  <img alt="week1" src="/task_html_css_intro/img/week1.jpg">
  <img alt="week2" src="/task_html_css_intro/img/week2.jpg"><br><br>

  So, ***codecademy*** courses about **HTML & CSS**, they very good for beginners (*for dummies*) because model of "information and immediate practice" give a chance to get a general view about what's going on.

  But for me, it was a little annoying to pass them chasing information, which I already know and repeated at Chaikin's course, in short, "*repetition is the mother of learning*".

  <img alt="codeacademy" src="/task_html_css_intro/img/codeacademy.jpg"><br><br>

  At all was nice to know about a few new things for me, that's opacity in `HEX (#fff01, etc)`, `hls (hlsa)` and `text-align: justify`.

## Responsive Web Design

  1. Just a good [article](https://web.dev/i18n/en/responsive-web-design-basics/).
  2. I'm familiar with [Flexbox Layout](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG5mPV60dMmjMRrHVW4LmV2x), it was nice to repeat my knowledge.<br><br>
  <img src="/task_responsive_web_design/img/flexbox.jpg"><br><br>
  3. Good [game](http://flexboxfroggy.com/), already played before.<br><br>
  <img src="/task_responsive_web_design/img/flexbox_froggy.jpg"><br><br>
  4. It was a powerful experience, a very good [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG5pXQrW_kDaeZb_uIAMNZIm) about Grid Layout, now I understand how I can use it, but in the future I need more self-practice.<br><br>
  <img src="/task_responsive_web_design/img/grid.jpg"><br>
  > It was quite funny to see that some problems are much easier to solve than in Flexbox, I should have known this before, but "it is what it is" :)<br>
  5. A good [game](http://cssgridgarden.com/), it was more difficult for me to pass it than *Flexbox Froggy*, but its usefulness in question, just confused me more.<br><br>

## JS Basics

  So, it was a lot of new information for me, and it was much harder to pass tasks than I expected.<br>
  But at least now I know much more than I knew before about JS and wanna practice with my new knowledge on real tasks.<br><br>

  <img width="49%" src="/task_js_basics/img/js_basics_1.jpg">
  <img width="49%" src="/task_js_basics/img/js_basics_2.jpg"><br><br>

  > At this point, I didn't notice that I'm doing a module, that I don't need to do right now. <br>
  But learn something new about regular expressions was really interesting, because for me regexps always looked like abracadabra :D
  
  <br>

  > It Was At This Moment [**freeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Knew... He *ucked Up.
  
  <br>

  <img src="/task_js_basics/img/oops.jpg"><br>

  I suddenly noticed that I can't log in my account and I can't create new one, because dev guys from *freeCodeCamp*, how said one of our mentors: "they messed up earlier when doing their work" (it's a long story).<br>
  So I just passed all tasks without progress saves and that's a reason why I can't show my screenshots of progress, just believe on my words. <br>

  > And you know what funnies thing, they restored my account just right at the moment that I was typing this text. But I don't want to pass all of these tasks again only for screenshots, just want to move on.

  Just a nice module about DOM with basics information.<br>
  <img src="/task_js_dom/img/cousera.jpg"> <br>

  It was interesting to solve exercises.<br>
  <img src="/task_js_dom/img/fcc.jpg"><br>

  And drumroll ... there is result of learning :)<br>
