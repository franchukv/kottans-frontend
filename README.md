   Thanks to the **"Introduction to Git and GitHub"** course, I refreshed my knowledge of Git and learned several useful and previously unknown commands.<br><br>

   The site [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) surprised me with the fact that there is something similar for studying Git, it was interesting to go through the tasks, I consider it very useful for learning the material that there is an opportunity to visually work with quite abstract concepts, such as brunches, etc.<br><br>

  > P.S. Previously, I already created a Git **[Git cheat sheet](https://github.com/franchukv/Git-Commands/)** for myself, in which I described all the commands I know in my own words.

[Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/) was an interesting journey, I know that Linus Torvalds created Linux and Git, so it was interesting to see the same decisions in the command names and in general to observe the behavior and logic of the system.

Articles about **HTTP** was interesting and useful. I found them some hard to understand some details at first because of a lot of theory, but at end of article I found that all this puzzle was made up correct in my head!<br><br>
So definitely all this information will be useful in the future to understand some things.
